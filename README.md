This is my journey through Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Here is an image of the current output of the ray tracer

## Instructions
*This project depends on the stb library for the jpg writer*

To build and run simply use 
`make test`

### My Notes
- He uses the ppm file format to save the images and mentions using the stb_image library for other formats so I created an image class in lib/image.hpp that write to different file formats. Currently the only file formats I support are ppm and jpg but I could easily use stb_image to add more.
- The strategy for hemispherical rendering is useful for creating rays pointing outward or inward from the hit point which could be useful for subsurface scattering. I'll have to do some research to see if this initial thought is correct...
